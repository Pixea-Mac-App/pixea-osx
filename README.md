## What is Pixea?  

Pixea is an advanced image viewer tailored for macOS, built to provide an exceptional balance between performance and visual quality. It allows users to browse, inspect, and manage image files quickly — whether you’re editing design assets, reviewing photography work, or simply organizing your gallery.  

The app is capable of displaying nearly every image format, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, PSD, RAW, WebP, BMP, and more. Thanks to its modern macOS-native interface, Pixea delivers a smooth, responsive experience while maintaining system efficiency, even when handling large, high-resolution files.  

Pixea isn’t just a simple photo viewer — it includes practical features like EXIF data inspection, ICC color profile reading, image rotation, zooming, quick keyboard navigation, and customizable shortcuts. You can also manage your library directly from within the app, moving or deleting files without leaving the viewer.  

Optimized for Apple Silicon chips, Pixea ensures fast performance on M1/M2 Macs, making it a reliable and visually refined solution for photographers, graphic designers, and digital artists. Its minimal interface focuses on what matters — your images — without unnecessary distractions.  

If you’re looking for a clean, capable, and powerful image viewer built specifically for macOS, Pixea delivers a professional-grade experience in a lightweight package.
